The CIFAR-10 data consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images in the official data. We have preserved the train/test split from the original dataset.  The provided files are:

train.7z - a folder containing the training images in png format
test.7z - a folder containing the test images in png format
trainLabels.csv - the training labels

The label classes in the dataset are:

airplane 
automobile 
bird 
cat 
deer 
dog 
frog 
horse 
ship 
truck
The classes are completely mutually exclusive. There is no overlap between automobiles and trucks. "Automobile" includes sedans, SUVs, things of that sort. "Truck" includes only big trucks. Neither includes pickup trucks.
