# Deep-Learning 🎓

A collection of various deep learning architectures, models, and tips.

Contains PyTorch Notebooks on Computer Vision. (NLP soon)

## Latest✨ Projects: Cats Vs Dogs - ResNet18 (Let's see, what will model choose?)

### [Cats vs Dogs (Acc: ~95 %)](https://github.com/jaisal1311/Deep-Learning/tree/master/Computer%20Vision/Cats%F0%9F%90%B1%20Vs%20Dogs%20%F0%9F%90%B6(97%20%25)) 🐱 🆚 🐶
#### Using Kaggle Dataset and ImageNet stats for normalizing the data, the model acheived an accuracy of ~95% of Accuracy. 🙌
#### - In joint-efforts 🤝 with [San Sequeira](https://github.com/sansqra) ✌
